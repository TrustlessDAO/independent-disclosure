The researcher should edit this file and replace the current contents with the full report details. This should be done after deploying an IndependentDisclosure smart contract and associating this repository's initial commit hash with the on-chain agreement via the setCommitHash function.


> Note: These steps establish a provable timestamp of your discovery, ensuring that anyone intercepting or receiving the disclosure details from you cannot falsely claim they found it first.
