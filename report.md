The researcher should edit this file and replace the current contents with the full report details. This should be done after deploying an IndependentDisclosure smart contract and associating this repository's initial commit hash with the on-chain agreement via the setCommitHash function. These steps ensure that no one else can prove prior knowledge of the vulnerability.
