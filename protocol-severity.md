# Protocol Severity Designation

Category Implications:

* `Confirmed`: begins the extended timeline for settlement / mitigation. Protocol should complete [authorization.md](https://github.com/TrustlessDAO/independent-disclosure/blob/main/authorization.md) then DM the commit hash for the authorization to the researcher. Please send the hash from your official Telegram or Twitter. This way no dispute can arise as to the authenticity of the commitment. 

* `Non-Issue`: Gives researcher permission to go public with the full-report immediately.

* `Won't Fix`: This is a kind of confirmation. You should decide if you can accept the issues being disclosed publicaly if that is not ideal you should negotiate with the reseacher to settle on a fair price to keep the issue confidential. If no timely settlement is reached they can go public with the report.


Assessment below is to be completed by an authorized protocol representative.
