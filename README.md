# IndependentDisclosure: Peer-to-Peer Vulnerability Disclosure

## Overview
Welcome to the IndependentDisclosure repository. This repository is part of a decentralized, peer-to-peer vulnerability disclosure process that aims to facilitate responsible and efficient communication between security researchers and protocols affected by discovered vulnerabilities.

## Disclosure Process
As a protocol representative, you have been invited to collaborate on this private repository because a security researcher has identified a potential vulnerability in your protocol. The researcher has chosen to use the IndependentDisclosure process to disclose the vulnerability details to you securely and transparently.

Here's what you can expect from the disclosure process:

1. **Invitation**: The researcher has invited you as a collaborator to this private repository, granting you access to the vulnerability details.

2. **Vulnerability Report**: The researcher has provided a detailed vulnerability report in the `report.md` file within this repository. The report outlines the nature of the vulnerability, its potential impact, and any supporting evidence.

3. **IndependentDisclosure Contract**: The researcher has deployed an IndependentDisclosure smart contract, which serves as an immutable record of the disclosure process. The contract includes a reference to the initial commit hash of this repository, establishing a tamper-proof link between the contract and the vulnerability report.

4. **Collaborative Discussion**: You can use the GitHub issue tracking and discussion features within this repository to engage in a collaborative discussion with the researcher. This allows for secure communication, clarification of the vulnerability details, and coordination of remediation efforts.

5. **Disclosure Timeline**: The researcher and your protocol should agree on a reasonable timeline for addressing the vulnerability. This may involve a mutually agreed-upon waiting period, to be observd by the researcher, to allow for responsible disclosure and remediation.

6. **Resolution**: Once the vulnerability has been addressed, or if it is determined to be a non-issue, the researcher will update the `report.md` file to reflect the resolution status. The IndependentDisclosure contract will be updated to indicate the final outcome of the disclosure process.

## Protocol Expectations
To ensure a smooth and effective disclosure process, we kindly request the following from you as a protocol representative:

1. **Timely Response**: Please acknowledge receipt of the vulnerability report and provide an initial response within a reasonable timeframe (e.g., 48-72 hours).

2. **Good Faith Collaboration**: Engage in good faith discussions with the researcher, providing transparency and cooperation throughout the process.

3. **Responsible Disclosure**: Adhere to the agreed-upon timeline for addressing the vulnerability and coordinate with the researcher for responsible disclosure.

4. **Attribution and Recognition**: If applicable, consider providing appropriate attribution and recognition to the researcher for their responsible disclosure efforts.

## Researcher Expectations
The researcher is expected to:

1. **Detailed Reporting**: Provide a comprehensive vulnerability report, including necessary technical details and supporting evidence.

2. **Collaborative Engagement**: Engage in constructive discussions with the protocol representatives to facilitate a smooth resolution process.

3. **Responsible Disclosure**: Adhere to the agreed-upon timeline for disclosure and allow sufficient time for the protocol to address the vulnerability.

4. **Confidentiality**: Maintain the confidentiality of the vulnerability details until the agreed-upon disclosure timeline has been reached or the vulnerability has been resolved or deemed a non-issue.

## Contact Information
If you have any questions or concerns regarding the IndependentDisclosure process or the contents of this repository, please contact the researcher directly using the communication channels they have provided.

We appreciate your cooperation and commitment to enhancing the security of your protocol and the broader ecosystem.
