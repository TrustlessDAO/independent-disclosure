# IndependentDisclosure: Peer-to-Peer Vulnerability Disclosure

## Overview  
Welcome to the **IndependentDisclosure** repository. This repository is part of a peer-to-peer vulnerability disclosure process designed to facilitate responsible and efficient communication between security researchers and protocols.

---

## Protocol Action Items  

1. Review the [report.md](./report.md).  
2. Review the [initial-terms.md](./initial-terms.md).  
3. Assign a validity status in [protocol-assessment.md](./protocol-assessment.md).

## Disclosure Process  

As a protocol representative, you have been invited to this private repository because a security researcher has identified a potential vulnerability in your protocol. The researcher has chosen the IndependentDisclosure process to disclose the vulnerability details securely and transparently.  

Here’s an overview of the disclosure process:  

1. **Invitation**:  
   The researcher has invited you as a collaborator to this private repository, granting you access to the vulnerability details.  

2. **Vulnerability Report**:  
   The researcher has provided a detailed assessment in the [report.md](./report.md), outlining the nature of the vulnerability, its potential impact, and any supporting evidence.  

3. **IndependentDisclosure Contract**:  
   The researcher has deployed an [IndependentDisclosure smart contract](https://gist.github.com/0xKorok/cb1925bd68cf919b6d18181d46dd3cce). This contract serves as an immutable record of the disclosure process, including a reference to the initial commit hash of this repository, ensuring a tamper-proof link between the contract and the vulnerability report.  

4. **Collaborative Discussion**:  
   Use GitHub’s issue tracking and discussion features within this repository to engage in secure discussions with the researcher. This allows for clarifying vulnerability details, coordinating remediation efforts, and ensuring transparent communication during negotiations. These discussions may later be revealed in case of disputes to help reach a resolution or settlement.  

5. **Assessment Timeline**:  
   The researcher has proposed a suggested deadline for assessing the vulnerability in [initial-terms.md](./initial-terms.md). This timeline allows for designating the issue as either **"confirmed"**, **"non-issue"**, or **"won't fix"**.  
   - Typically, this takes 24–72 hours. For special circumstances requiring a longer period, the protocol must provide reasonable evidence to justify the extension.  

6. **Final Assessment**:  
   The protocol has full control over assigning one of the three validity designations (**"confirmed"**, **"non-issue"**, or **"won't fix"**). Before making a final decision, carefully review the implications described in [protocol-assessment.md](./protocol-assessment.md). This designation should be considered **binding**.

## Security Best Practices

**Important**: Both parties should maintain a local copy of this repository as crucial evidence throughout the disclosure process. This provides robust protection against potential history modifications. See the [researcher guide](https://www.thetrustlessdao.com/guides/researcher.html) and [protocol guide](https://www.thetrustlessdao.com/guides/protocol.html) for specific details about when to sync your local copy and why this is important.

## Protocol Expectations  

To ensure a smooth and effective disclosure process, we request the following from protocol representatives:  

1. **Timely Response**:  
   Acknowledge receipt of the vulnerability report and provide an initial assessment within a reasonable timeframe (e.g., 48–72 hours).  

2. **Good Faith Collaboration**:  
   Engage in transparent and cooperative discussions with the researcher throughout the process.  

3. **Responsible Disclosure**:  
   Adhere to the agreed-upon timeline for addressing the vulnerability and work with the researcher on responsible disclosure.  

4. **Attribution and Recognition**:  
   If applicable, provide appropriate attribution and recognition to the researcher for their responsible disclosure efforts.

## Researcher Expectations  

The researcher is expected to:  

1. **Detailed Reporting**:  
   Provide a comprehensive vulnerability report, including technical details and supporting evidence.  

2. **Collaborative Engagement**:  
   Participate in constructive discussions with protocol representatives to facilitate resolution.  

3. **Responsible Disclosure**:  
   Adhere to the agreed-upon timeline and allow the protocol sufficient time to address the vulnerability.  

4. **Confidentiality**:  
   Maintain the confidentiality of the vulnerability details until the agreed timeline has passed, the vulnerability has been resolved, or the protocol's final assessment permits disclosure.
