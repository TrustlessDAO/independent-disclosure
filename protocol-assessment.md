# Validity Assessment

Validity Implications:

* **Confirmed**:
     * Initiates the extended timeline for settlement and mitigation. The protocol should complete the steps outlined in [authorization.md](./authorization.md) and then DM the commit hash for the authorization to the researcher.
          * Please send the hash from your official Telegram or Twitter account to ensure there can be no dispute regarding the authenticity of the commitment.

* **Non-Issue**:
     * Ends the disclosure process. The researcher is granted permission to make the full report public immediately.

* **Won't Fix**:
     * A type of confirmation where the protocol opts not to address the issue.
          * If the protocol prefers to keep the issue private, it should negotiate a fair price with the researcher for maintaining confidentiality.
          * If a timely settlement is not reached, the researcher may make the report public.

Assessment below is to be completed by an authorized protocol representative. Select one response for each.
