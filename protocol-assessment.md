# Validity Assessment

Validity Implications:

* `Confirmed`: begins the extended timeline for settlement / mitigation. Protocol should complete [authorization.md](https://github.com/TrustlessDAO/independent-disclosure/blob/main/authorization.md) then DM the commit hash for the authorization to the researcher. Please send the hash from your official Telegram or Twitter. This way no dispute can arise as to the authenticity of the commitment. 

* `Non-Issue`: Ends the disclosure process. Gives researcher permission to go public with the full-report immediately

* `Won't Fix`: This is a kind of confirmation. Protocol should decide if it would prefer to keep the issue private if so they should negotiate with the researcher on a fair price to keep their their work confidential. If no timely settlement is reached they can go public with the report.

Assessment below is to be completed by an authorized protocol representative. Select one response for each.
